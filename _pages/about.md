I recently completed my Ph.D. at [INRIA](https://team.inria.fr/stars/en/), Sophia Antipolis, and Côte d'Azur University, under the supervision of Dr. François Brémond and Dr. Susanne Thümmler, supported by the prestigious [Marie Curie Co-Found Fellowship](https://univ-cotedazur.eu/boosturcareer/project-act4autism). My research focused on using deep learning and computer vision to analyze human behavior in videos, emphasizing action recognition, temporal action localization, and its applications in autism diagnosis.

Before my Ph.D., I worked as a research assistant in the Human-Computer Interaction Lab at Sejong University, South Korea, under the guidance of Prof. Yong-Guk Kim. I developed state-of-the-art methods for gaze estimation and eye-tracking using deep learning there. I earned my Master’s in Computer Engineering from Sejong University and my Bachelor’s in Electrical Engineering (majoring in Computer Engineering) from COMSATS University Islamabad.

I have worked on real-world challenges throughout my career, including creating datasets for autism behavior analysis and developing scalable machine-learning models for various applications. I have also collaborated on award-winning projects in hackathons focused on medical and satellite imaging.

Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, swimming, and traveling to explore new cultures and landscapes.
