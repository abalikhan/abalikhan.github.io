I am a PhD student at [INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-universite-cote-azur), Sophia Antipolis, and [Côte d'Azur University](https://univ-cotedazur.eu/) under [Marie Curie Co-Found Scholarship](https://univ-cotedazur.eu/boosturcareer/meet-the-fellows). My research focuses on analyzing human behavior using video data with a particular emphasis on action recognition and temporal action localization. 

Before joining INRIA, I worked as a research assistant at Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea in [Human-Computer-Interaction Lab](http://203.250.148.104/about_us.php). My research there was mainly focused on gaze estimation and eye-tracking under the guidance of [Prof. Yong-Guk Kim](http://home.sejong.ac.kr/~ykim/). I recieved my Masters degree from Sejong University with a major in Computer Engineering. 
I obtained my bachelors degree in Eletrical Engineering with a major in Computer Engineering from [COMSTATS University Islamabad, Pakistan](https://cuiwah.edu.pk/)

In my spare time I enjoy hiking, travelling, and swimming.
